## üîß Architecture Details

### LangGraph Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí Message Classifier ‚Üí Router ‚Üí [ChatBot | Tool Agent] ‚Üí Response
```

1. **Message Classifier**: Determines if the input requires tool usage or direct LLM response
2. **Router**: Routes the message to appropriate handler based on classification
3. **ChatBot**: Handles general conversation and follow-up questions
4. **Tool Agent**: Selects and executes appropriate tools for information gathering
5. **RAG Functions**: Converts and processes text chunks for smarter, context-aware responses; use functions from the `rag/` folder for maximum flexibility

---

### Tool System

Tools are defined using Pydantic models for structured input/output:

```python
class duckduckgo_search(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="Search query for DuckDuckGo...")

search_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(
    func=search_duckduckgo,
    name="DuckDuckGoSearch",
    description="For general web searches (recent info, facts, news).",
    args_schema=duckduckgo_search,
)
```

---

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

- **Flexible RAG Functions:**  
  Use the functions in the `rag/` folder to convert text or document chunks for use with retrieval-augmented generation. This gives your AI the flexibility to pull in the most relevant information from your own data.
- **Neo4j Graph Support:**  
  The `rag/neo4j_rag.py` script lets you extract knowledge triples and store them in a Neo4j graph database. This is useful for graph-based retrieval, allowing the AI to reason over relationships in your data.

---

### Concurrency for Faster Responses

- **How it's used:**  
  The agent can handle multiple tasks at the same time, making it much faster for users‚Äîespecially when dealing with many requests or complex workflows.

---

### Flexible Error Logging with `utils` Package

- **Log errors anywhere:**  
  Use scripts from the `utils` package to log errors wherever you need‚Äîwhether to the console, to a file, or even across the network (using sockets) with `error_transpher.py`. This is perfect for debugging distributed systems or logging errors from remote processes.

## üéØ Why LangGraph is Better

### Advantages of LangGraph Implementation:

1. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new tools by defining argument and response data classes
2. **Versatility**: Support for multiple LLMs and tools with minimal configuration
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic classification between chat and tool usage
4. **State Management**: Better conversation context handling
5. **Structured Outputs**: Type-safe tool interactions with Pydantic models
6. **Scalability**: Graph-based architecture for complex workflows
7. **RAG Integration**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation features, including graph-based retrieval with Neo4j
8. **Concurrency**: Handles multiple requests at once for faster user experience
9. **Flexible Logging**: Print or transmit error logs anywhere using scripts from the `utils` package

## üîå Adding Custom Tools

To add a new tool to the LangGraph implementation:

1. **Define the tool function**:
   ```python
   def my_custom_tool(param1: str, param2: int) -> str:
       # Your tool logic here
       return "Tool result"
   ```

2. **Create a Pydantic model for arguments**:
   ```python
   class MyCustomToolArgs(BaseModel):
       param1: str = Field(description="Description of param1")
       param2: int = Field(description="Description of param2")
   ```

3. **Register the tool**:
   ```python
   custom_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(
       func=my_custom_tool,
       name="MyCustomTool",
       description="What this tool does",
       args_schema=MyCustomToolArgs,
   )
   
   # Add to tools list
   tools.append(custom_tool)
   ```
