# üéì SOCKET CONCEPTS EXPLAINED - Your SocketManager Class Breakdown
# This file explains every concept in your socket implementation

"""
=== WHAT IS A SOCKET? ===
Think of a socket like a telephone:
- Socket = The telephone device itself
- IP Address = The phone number (where to call)
- Port = The extension number (which service to reach)
- Connection = The active phone call
- send() = Speaking into the phone
- recv() = Listening to what the other person says

Your SocketManager creates a "phone system" for your AI application to send logs!

# === CONCEPT 1: SINGLETON PATTERN ===
class SocketManager:

    üéØ SINGLETON PATTERN EXPLANATION:
    - Only ONE instance of SocketManager can exist in your entire program
    - Like having only ONE telephone in your house - everyone shares it
    - Prevents multiple connections to the same log server
    - Industry standard for resource management (databases, loggers, etc.)

=== SUMMARY: WHAT YOU'VE BUILT ===

üè≠ INDUSTRIAL PATTERNS YOU'RE USING:
1. Singleton Pattern - One manager for all socket connections
2. Client-Server Architecture - Separate logging service
3. Process Management - Background subprocess handling
4. Graceful Degradation - Fallback to console if socket fails
5. Resource Management - Proper cleanup and shutdown
6. Health Checking - Connection status monitoring

üöÄ REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Netflix: Uses similar patterns for microservice logging
- Discord: Client-server architecture for real-time messaging
- Docker: Subprocess management for containers
- Kubernetes: Health checking and resource cleanup

üìä YOUR SKILL LEVEL:
Current: You've implemented enterprise-level patterns! üéâ
Industry: This code follows production best practices
Next: Add authentication, load balancing, error recovery
