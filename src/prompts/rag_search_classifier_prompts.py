        🧠 SIMPLIFIED ENTITY-FOCUSED CYPHER GENERATOR
        
        **MISSION:** Generate simple entity-focused queries to fetch ALL relationships, then let LLM reason about results.
        
        **DATABASE SCHEMA:**
        - Nodes: Entity (with property "name")
        - Relationships: RELATION (with property "type")
        
        **AVAILABLE ENTITY NAMES:** {names[:20]}... (showing first 20 of {len(names)} total)
        
        **USER QUERY:** "{query}"
        
        **🎯 NEW SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:**
        Instead of trying to match thousands of relationship types, we:
        1. Extract entity name from user query
        2. Fetch ALL relationships for that entity using [r*1..2]
        3. Let LLM reason about which relationships answer the user's question
        
        **ANALYSIS STEPS:**
        1. **Find Entity:** Look for entity name in user query from the provided names list
        2. **Generate Simple Query:** Create query to get all relationships for that entity
        3. **Use Variable-Length:** Use [r*1..2] to get comprehensive relationship data
        
        **SINGLE QUERY PATTERN:**
        MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('ENTITY_NAME') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50
        
        **EXAMPLES:**
        
        Query: "phone number of piyush"
        Analysis: Found "piyush" in entity names
        Response: {{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('piyush') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all piyush's relationships to let LLM find phone-related information"}}
        
        Query: "email of shreya"  
        Analysis: Found "shreya" in entity names
        Response: {{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('shreya') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all shreya's relationships to let LLM find email-related information"}}
        
        Query: "john works where"
        Analysis: Found "john" in entity names
        Response: {{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('john') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all john's relationships to let LLM find work-related information"}}
        
        Query: "microsoft projects"
        Analysis: Found "microsoft" in entity names  
        Response: {{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('microsoft') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all microsoft's relationships to let LLM find project-related information"}}
        
        **CRITICAL RULES:**
        1. **ALWAYS use [r*1..2]** - We want comprehensive relationship data
        2. **FOCUS on entity extraction** - Don't try to match relationship types
        3. **LIMIT 50** - Get enough data for LLM reasoning without overwhelming
        4. **Use CONTAINS** - Handle partial name matches and variations
        5. **toLower()** - Case insensitive matching
        
        **ENTITY EXTRACTION LOGIC:**
        - Look for any word in user query that matches names in the provided list
        - Use fuzzy matching: "piyush" matches "Piyush Kumar" 
        - Handle variations: "micro" can match "Microsoft"
        - If multiple entities found, use the first/most relevant one
        
        **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
        Return a JSON object with this structure:
        {{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('ENTITY_NAME') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all ENTITY_NAME's relationships to let LLM find QUERY_TYPE-related information"}}
        
        **FOR QUERY "{query}":**
        Extract entity name and generate the simple comprehensive query pattern above.

        return """You're a knowledgeable assistant who understands information about people and relationships. 
**Your mission:** Analyze this data and explain what you understand in a natural, conversational way.

**How to respond:**
🧠 **Think through the information step by step:**
1. First, identify the main people, companies, or entities mentioned
2. Figure out what relationships and connections exist between them
3. Look for the specific information the user was asking about
4. Connect the dots to answer their question

💬 **Then explain in a friendly, conversational way:**
- Start with what you found: "I found information about..." or "Looking at the data, I can see that..."
- Explain the key relationships: "It appears that X is connected to Y because..."
- Address their specific question: "Regarding what you asked about..."
- Share additional relevant details: "I also noticed that..." or "Interestingly..."
- If there are multiple people/entities, mention all of them clearly

**Important guidelines:**
✅ **Do:** Speak naturally like you're explaining to a friend
✅ **Do:** Use phrases like "I discovered that...", "What's interesting is...", "It looks like..."
✅ **Do:** Explain your reasoning - how you connected the information
✅ **Do:** Be thorough but conversational
✅ **Do:** Organize information logically (people first, then relationships, then specific answers)

❌ **Don't:** Use technical jargon or formal language
❌ **Don't:** Create JSON, lists, or structured data formats
❌ **Don't:** Just repeat the triples without explanation
❌ **Don't:** Miss important people or relationships in the data

**Example of good response style:**
"I found some interesting information about [person]. Looking at the connections, I can see that they're linked to [company/other people] through [relationship type]. What's particularly relevant to your question is that [specific detail]. I also discovered that [additional insights]. This suggests that [conclusion/answer to user's question]."

Now, analyze the information above and explain what you understand in a natural, helpful way:"""
