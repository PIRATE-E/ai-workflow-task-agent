    # ==================== KNOWLEDGE GRAPH PROMPTS ====================

    @staticmethod
    def cypher_query_generator(names: list, relationship_types: list, labels: list, query: str) -> str:
        """
        System prompt for Cypher query generation.
        Used in: retrieve_knowledge_graph()
        """
        return f"""🧠 SIMPLIFIED CYPHER QUERY GENERATOR

**MISSION:** Generate simple entity-focused queries and let LLM reason about results later.

**DATABASE SCHEMA:**
- Nodes: Entity (with property "name")  
- Relationships: RELATION (with property "type")

**AVAILABLE ENTITY NAMES:** {names[:20]}... (showing first 20 of {len(names)} total)

**USER QUERY:** "{query}"

**🎯 SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:**
Instead of trying to match specific relationship types, we'll:
1. Find the entity name in the user query
2. Fetch ALL relationships for that entity
3. Let LLM reason about which relationships answer the user's question

**ANALYSIS STEPS:**
1. **Extract Entity Name:** Find entity name from user query in the provided names list
2. **Generate Simple Query:** Create query to fetch all relationships for that entity
3. **Use Variable-Length Relationships:** Use [r*1..2] to get comprehensive results

**QUERY PATTERN:**
MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('ENTITY_NAME') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50

**FOR THIS QUERY "{query}":**
- Extract entity name (e.g., "piyush", "shreya", "john")
- Generate query to fetch all their relationships
- Return comprehensive results for LLM post-processing

**EXAMPLE:**
User Query: "phone number of piyush"
Generated Query: MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('piyush') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50
Reasoning: Fetch all piyush's relationships, let LLM find phone-related ones

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{{"cypher_query": "MATCH (s:Entity)-[r*1..2]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('ENTITY_NAME') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 50", "reasoning": "Fetching all relationships for ENTITY_NAME to let LLM reason about user's specific question"}}

**CRITICAL:** Focus on entity extraction, not relationship type matching!

**STEP 2: INTELLIGENT DATA MATCHING**
- **MANDATORY:** Analyze user query tokens against the PROVIDED DATA ONLY
- **Entity Matching:** Find the best matching entity names from the AVAILABLE ENTITY NAMES list
- **Relationship Matching:** Find the best matching relationship types from the AVAILABLE RELATIONSHIP TYPES list
- **Fuzzy Matching Rules:**
  - "phone" or "number" → look for relationship types containing "phone"
  - "email" or "mail" → look for relationship types containing "email"  
  - "work" → look for relationship types containing "work"
  - Use partial string matching and semantic similarity

**STEP 3: DYNAMIC QUERY TYPE DETERMINATION**

🎯 **TYPE 1: ENTITY_ONLY_SEARCH**
- **Condition:** Found matching entity name(s) in PROVIDED DATA, no relationship match
- **Pattern:** MATCH (s:Entity)-[r:RELATION]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('MATCHED_ENTITY_FROM_DATA') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 20

🎯 **TYPE 2: RELATIONSHIP_ONLY_SEARCH**  
- **Condition:** Found matching relationship type(s) in PROVIDED DATA, no entity match
- **Pattern:** MATCH (s:Entity)-[r:RELATION]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(r.type) CONTAINS toLower('MATCHED_RELATIONSHIP_FROM_DATA') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 20

🎯 **TYPE 3: COMBINED_SEARCH**
- **Condition:** Found BOTH matching entity AND relationship in PROVIDED DATA
- **Pattern:** MATCH (s:Entity)-[r:RELATION]-(o:Entity) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS toLower('MATCHED_ENTITY_FROM_DATA') AND toLower(r.type) CONTAINS toLower('MATCHED_RELATIONSHIP_FROM_DATA') RETURN s, r, o LIMIT 20

**STEP 4: SMART QUERY GENERATION**
- **ONLY use entities and relationships that exist in the PROVIDED DATA**
- **NEVER invent or assume data that isn't in the lists**
- **Use the EXACT relationship type strings from the provided list**
- **Use the EXACT entity names from the provided list**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS WORKFLOW - USE PROVIDED DATA ONLY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MANDATORY ANALYSIS PROCESS:**

1. **PARSE USER QUERY:** Break "{query}" into individual tokens/words
2. **MATCH ENTITIES:** Find which tokens match ANY entity name from the PROVIDED ENTITY NAMES list
3. **MATCH RELATIONSHIPS:** Find which tokens match ANY relationship type from the PROVIDED RELATIONSHIP TYPES list
4. **DETERMINE TYPE:** Based on what matches were found in the PROVIDED DATA

**MATCHING LOGIC:**
- **Entity Matching:** Check if any query token appears in (or partially matches) any name from: {names}
- **Relationship Matching:** Check if any query token appears in (or partially matches) any type from: {relationship_types}
- **Use CONTAINS matching:** "phone" should match "has phone number", "email" should match "has email address"

**QUERY GENERATION RULES:**
- **ENTITY_ONLY:** If found entity match(es) but NO relationship match → Use entity pattern
- **RELATIONSHIP_ONLY:** If found relationship match(es) but NO entity match → Use relationship pattern  
- **COMBINED:** If found BOTH entity AND relationship matches → Use combined pattern
- **FALLBACK:** If no matches found → Use first available entity from provided data

**RESPONSE EXAMPLES BASED ON PROVIDED DATA:**
- If user query contains entity from your list → use that exact entity name
- If user query contains relationship hint → find best matching relationship from your list
- NEVER use entities or relationships not in the provided lists

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE THESE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **FORBIDDEN LABELS:** NEVER use :User, :Person, :Company, :Organization - ONLY use :Entity and :RELATION
2. **FUZZY MATCHING:** Use your intelligence to match user terms to available data (handle misspellings)
3. **CASE INSENSITIVE:** ALWAYS use toLower() for all string comparisons
4. **JSON FORMAT:** ALWAYS return valid JSON with "cypher_query" and "reasoning" keys
5. **LIMIT RESULTS:** ALWAYS add LIMIT 20 to prevent overwhelming results
6. **USE AVAILABLE DATA:** Only reference entities and relationships from the provided lists
7. **FLEXIBLE MATCHING:** Use CONTAINS instead of exact matches for better results

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 SMART MATCHING LOGIC:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Entity Matching:**
- "raghav" → exact match in entity names
- "micro" → fuzzy match to "Microsoft" in entity names
- "john" → exact match in entity names

**Relationship Matching:**
- "email" → fuzzy match to "has email address" in relationship types
- "work" → fuzzy match to "works at" in relationship types  
- "phone" → fuzzy match to "has phone number" in relationship types
- "manage" → fuzzy match to "manages" in relationship types

**OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):**
Return ONLY valid JSON: {{"cypher_query": "YOUR_CYPHER_HERE", "reasoning": "YOUR_REASONING_HERE"}}

**MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS FOR QUERY: "{query}"**

1. **TOKENIZE QUERY:** Break "{query}" into words: [list each word]
2. **SCAN ENTITY NAMES:** Check each query token against provided entity names list
   - Found entity matches: [list any matches from the provided names list]
3. **SCAN RELATIONSHIP TYPES:** Check each query token against provided relationship types list  
   - Found relationship matches: [list any matches from the provided relationship_types list]
4. **DETERMINE QUERY TYPE:** Based on matches found above
5. **GENERATE CYPHER:** Use ONLY the matched entities/relationships from provided data

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** 
- ONLY use data from the provided lists: {names} and {relationship_types}
- NEVER invent entities or relationships not in these lists
- If no exact match, find the CLOSEST match from the provided data
- Always explain your matching logic in the reasoning

**FINAL INSTRUCTION:** Analyze the user query "{query}" using this exact workflow and generate the most appropriate Cypher query based ONLY on the provided available data.

        return """You are an intelligent RAG system selector that understands both user intent and document characteristics.

**Your Mission:**
Analyze the user's question and the document content to choose the most effective search approach.

**Understanding the User's Intent:**
- Look at their current question AND the conversation history
- Consider what type of answer they're seeking
- Understand if they're asking about relationships, facts, summaries, or explanations

**Available RAG Types:**

1. **Knowledge Graph RAG** - Best for:
   - Questions about relationships: "How is X connected to Y?"
   - Entity-focused queries: "What companies work with Microsoft?"
   - Network analysis: "Show me the connections between..."
   - Structured data with clear entities and relationships

2. **Text RAG** - Best for:
   - Content summaries: "What is this document about?"
   - Detailed explanations: "Explain how X works"
   - Narrative information: stories, procedures, descriptions
   - Unstructured text content

**Smart Decision Making:**
- If the user previously mentioned a specific RAG type, respect their preference
- Consider the document structure - does it contain entities and relationships, or is it narrative text?
- Think about what would give the user the most useful answer

**Context Awareness:**
- Review the conversation history to understand the user's ongoing needs
- If they're building on a previous question, consider continuity
- Look for implicit preferences based on their question style

**EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- If the user explicitly asks for a knowledge graph search, prioritize that
- If they ask for a text search, prioritize that

**Response Format:**
{
  "selected_rag_type": "knowledge_graph" or "text",
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation of why this choice best serves the user's needs, considering both their question and the document characteristics"

**Your Task:** Analyze the user's message within the full conversation context to determine if they need:
- 'llm': Direct conversation, reasoning, or explanation
- 'tool': External information or specific actions

**Conversation Context:**
{history}

**Current Message:**
{content}

**Smart Classification Rules:**

1. **Context-Aware Analysis:**
   - Consider what the user discussed previously
   - Look for references to earlier messages ("that", "it", "the previous", "what we talked about")
   - Understand follow-up questions and clarifications

2. **Tool Usage Indicators:**
   - Explicit requests: "search", "find", "look up", "translate", "rag search"
   - Need for current/external information: "latest news", "recent updates", "current price"
   - Document analysis: "search in the document", "find in the knowledge base"

3. **LLM Response Indicators:**
   - Explanations of previous results: "explain that", "what does this mean", "clarify"
   - Reasoning about conversation: "why did you say", "how does this relate"
   - General conversation: greetings, opinions, analysis of provided information
   - Follow-up questions about tool results

4. **Override Rules:**
   - User explicitly says "use AI/assistant/LLM" → always 'llm'
   - User explicitly says "search/tool" → always 'tool'

**Key Insight:** If the user is asking about or referencing something already discussed or provided in the conversation, they likely want explanation/reasoning (llm), not new information (tool).

Classify thoughtfully based on true user intent, not just keywords."""

**Available Tools:**
{tools_context}

**Conversation Context Analysis:**
Full conversation history: {history}
Current user request: {content}

**Smart Tool Selection Logic:**

1. **Context-Aware Reasoning:**
   - If the user references previous messages ('that result', 'the search we did', 'translate that'), understand what they're referring to
   - Consider the flow of conversation - are they asking for new information or clarification of existing information?
   - Look for implicit requests based on conversation context

2. **Tool Selection Criteria:**
   - **GoogleSearch**: For current information, facts, news, or anything requiring web search
   - **RAGSearch**: For document analysis, knowledge base queries, or file-specific searches
   - **Translatetool**: For language translation requests
   - **'none'**: For explanations, clarifications, reasoning, or general conversation

3. **Context-Sensitive Examples:**
   - User: 'search for AI news' → GoogleSearch with query 'AI news'
   - User: 'what does that mean?' (after a search result) → 'none' (explanation needed)
   - User: 'translate the previous message to Spanish' → Translatetool with message from history
   - User: 'find information about quantum computing in the document' → RAGSearch
   - User: 'explain how that works' (referring to previous content) → 'none'

4. **Parameter Extraction Intelligence:**
   - Extract parameters from current message AND conversation history when relevant
   - If user says 'translate that', find the 'that' in conversation history
   - If user says 'search for more about X' where X was mentioned before, use context
   - If user says 'RAG SEARCH :- {{query}}', extract the query and use it for RAG search
   - If user says 'search on web  :- {{query}}', extract the query and use it for RAG search

**Response Format:**
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "tool_name": "TOOL_NAME or none",
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision based on context and user intent",
  "parameters": {{"param": "value"}} // Extract from message and/or conversation history
}}

**Key Principle:** Think like a human assistant who understands context, references, and the natural flow of conversation. Don't just match keywords - understand intent."""
