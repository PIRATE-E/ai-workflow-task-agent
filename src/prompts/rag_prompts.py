**Your Mission:**
Analyze document content to determine the most effective RAG approach and provide insights about the document's characteristics.

**Analysis Dimensions:**

1. **Content Structure:**
   - Is the content primarily narrative or structured?
   - Are there clear entities and relationships?
   - Is information hierarchically organized?

2. **Information Density:**
   - How much factual information per section?
   - Are there lists, tables, or structured data?
   - What's the ratio of descriptive vs. factual content?

3. **Entity Presence:**
   - Are there clear named entities (people, places, organizations)?
   - Are relationships between entities explicitly stated?
   - Would a knowledge graph representation be beneficial?

4. **Query Suitability:**
   - What types of questions would this document answer well?
   - Is it better for specific fact retrieval or conceptual understanding?
   - Are there cross-references and connections within the document?

**Your Task:**
Extract entities and relationships from text to create a structured knowledge graph representation.

**Extraction Guidelines:**

1. **Entity Identification:**
   - People: Names, roles, titles
   - Organizations: Companies, institutions, groups
   - Locations: Cities, countries, addresses
   - Concepts: Technologies, methodologies, ideas
   - Objects: Products, tools, systems

2. **Relationship Extraction:**
   - Direct relationships: "works at", "located in", "part of"
   - Implicit relationships: "collaborates with", "influences", "depends on"
   - Temporal relationships: "founded", "acquired", "succeeded"
   - Hierarchical relationships: "reports to", "contains", "manages"

3. **Quality Standards:**
   - Use consistent entity naming
   - Normalize relationship types
   - Maintain relationship directionality
   - Include confidence scores for uncertain extractions

2. **Information Synthesis:**
   - Combine information from multiple relevant chunks
   - Maintain logical flow and coherence
   - Resolve conflicts by prioritizing more authoritative sources

3. **Context Preservation:**
   - Maintain important context from the original document
   - Preserve nuances and qualifications
   - Include relevant background information

4. **Answer Optimization:**
   - Structure the response logically
   - Use appropriate level of detail
   - Include examples and explanations when helpful

**Response Guidelines:**
- Start with a direct answer to the query
- Provide supporting details and context
- Mention any limitations or uncertainties
- Suggest related topics or follow-up questions

**Coordination Strategy:**

1. **Result Analysis:**
   - Evaluate knowledge graph results for factual accuracy and relationships
   - Assess text search results for context and detailed explanations
   - Identify complementary information from both sources

2. **Information Integration:**
   - Use knowledge graph for structured facts and relationships
   - Use text search for detailed explanations and context
   - Resolve any conflicts between the two sources

3. **Response Synthesis:**
   - Lead with the most relevant information source
   - Integrate supporting information from the secondary source
   - Maintain coherence and logical flow
