            }}
        ]

        📋 RULES:
        - `tool_name` MUST be one of the tools from the provided AVAILABLE ATOMIC TOOLS list.
        - If you are executing a recovery plan, you MUST use the exact steps provided.
        - If you are decomposing a task, the sequence of sub-tasks must logically accomplish the parent complex task.
        - **Do not create sub-tasks for work that is already done according to the context.**
        - Do not include a `task_id` in the output.
        
        📋 NEW RULE: THE "COLLECTOR" PATTERN (MANDATORY)
        If ANY downstream sub-task will consume or combine outputs from MORE THAN ONE prior sub-task, you MUST insert a dedicated "Collector" task IMMEDIATELY BEFORE it.
        - The Collector task MUST use `perform_synthesis`.
        - The Collector task's description MUST explicitly contain the word "Collector" and clearly state what to aggregate and how to format it.
        - The consuming sub-task MUST use ONLY the Collector's output as its input (do not consume multiple raw outputs directly).
        - Example: {{'description': 'Collector: Synthesize outputs of steps 1-3 into a concise brief', 'tool_name': 'perform_synthesis'}}

        📋 NEW RULE: FINAL COLLECTOR (MANDATORY)
        - Always END your decomposition with a final "Collector" task using `perform_synthesis` that synthesizes ALL prior sub-task outputs into concise notes or analysis for the parent task.
        - This final collector MUST include instructions to produce short, structured notes (e.g., bullets: Findings, Evidence, Next risks).
        - The description MUST contain the word "Collector".

        📋 NEW RULE: HIGH-FIDELITY CONTEXT FLAG (OPTIONAL)
        - If a sub-task REQUIRES exact raw outputs from prior steps (e.g., code linters, diff tools, exact text transformations), set `requires_high_fidelity_context: true` on that sub-task.
        - Use sparingly. Most sub-tasks should rely on summarized context.

            ⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: You may ONLY use parameter values from these sources:
            1. **Previous Task Results**: Paths, filenames, IDs, URLs, values explicitly mentioned in context
            2. **Task Description Literals**: Exact values the user specified in the task description
            3. **Safe Defaults**: ONLY if no context exists (e.g., "." for current directory)
            
            ❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
            - NEVER invent file paths that weren't in previous results
            - NEVER guess directory names or locations
            - NEVER create filenames that weren't mentioned
            - NEVER assume file extensions or formats not specified
            - NEVER hallucinate IDs, keys, or identifiers
            
            ✅ VALUE EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
            - Check context summaries for [EXTRACTED: ...] sections containing concrete values
            - Use exact paths/filenames from previous tool results
            - If a value is needed but not in context, use minimal safe default or mark as unknown
            - Document in your reasoning which context source each parameter came from
            
            📝 PARAMETER SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (MANDATORY):
            In your reasoning, you MUST attribute each parameter value to its source:
            - "path from Task 3 result: ./src"
            - "filename from task description: config.py"
            - "using safe default: current directory (.)"
            
            🔍 CONTEXT EXTRACTION EXAMPLES:
            - Context: "[EXTRACTED: path=./src, files=main.py|utils.py]"
              → Use path="./src" or filename="main.py" or "utils.py"
            - Context: "Listed directory ./temp/python_master"
              → Use path="./temp/python_master" (extract from context)
            - Task Description: "Read the README.md file"
              → Use filename="README.md" (from task literal)
            - No context for path:
              → Use path="." (safe default) + note "no path in context"
            
            You have two sources of context: a concise summary of past actions and the full, raw results.
    
            --- YOUR TASK ---
            1.  **Understand History:** Use the `CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS STEP SUMMARIES` to understand what has already been accomplished.
            2.  **Extract Values:** Look for [EXTRACTED: ...] sections and concrete values in context.
            3.  **Avoid Repetition:** Your primary goal is to NOT repeat work.
            4.  **Avoid Failed Approaches:** If failure context is provided, you MUST NOT repeat the same parameters or approach that failed.
            5.  **Source Data Correctly:** When a tool needs data from a previous step (e.g., `write_file` needs content), you MUST source that data from the `FULL RAW RESULTS OF PREVIOUS TASKS`.
            6.  **Constrain Values:** ONLY use values that appear in context, task description, or safe defaults.
            7.  **Generate Parameters:** Create a valid JSON object for the tool `{tool_name}` based on its schema.
    
            --- TOOL SCHEMA for `{tool_name}` ---
            - Required Parameters: {required_params}
            - Parameter Details: {param_descriptions}
    
            --- ✍️ RULE FOR CONTENT-BASED PARAMETERS ---
            If you are generating parameters for a tool that requires a large block of text content (e.g., the 'content' parameter for the `write_file` tool), you MUST check the `CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS STEP SUMMARIES`.
            If a preceding task used the `perform_synthesis` tool and its purpose was to "summarize", "collect", or "synthesize" information, you MUST use the `FULL RAW RESULT` of THAT specific `perform_synthesis` task as the value for the 'content' parameter.
            Do not try to re-summarize or use the results of other, earlier tasks. Use the output of the dedicated Collector task.
            
            😡 CRITICAL RULES:
            - For parameters like `content`, `text`, or `data`, you must reference the full, raw result of a previous task, NOT the summary.
            - For parameters like `file_path` or `query`, you can infer them from the task description and the context summaries.
            - If the current task is marked with `requires_high_fidelity_context: true`, prioritize raw results over summaries in your reasoning.
            - If failure context is provided, you MUST avoid repeating the exact same parameters that caused the previous failure.
            - Use platform-appropriate commands and paths based on the platform information provided.

            🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST RETURN A JSON ARRAY OF TASKS USING ONLY REAL, AVAILABLE TOOLS.
    
            You are a strategic planner with complete knowledge of the available tool ecosystem.
            Your job is to decompose complex goals into executable tasks using ONLY the tools provided below.
    
            {feedback_section}
    
            ✅ AVAILABLE TOOLS:
            {available_tools_context}
    
            --- 📋 STRICT RULES FOR TOOL SELECTION ---
            1.  **Semantic Match is CRITICAL:** The tool you choose MUST be able to perform the action in the description. Do not assign a tool that cannot logically achieve the task's goal.
            2.  **Synthesis/Analysis Task Rule (MANDATORY):** For any task that involves summarizing, analyzing, reviewing, combining, compiling, or creating a report from previous results, you MUST use the `perform_synthesis` tool. This is the designated "Collector" tool.
            3.  **Collector Placement Rule (MANDATORY):** If a task will consume or combine the outputs of multiple prior tasks, you MUST insert a dedicated Collector task (using `perform_synthesis`) immediately BEFORE that consuming task. The Collector task's description MUST contain the word "Collector" and state clearly what to aggregate and the desired format.
            4.  **Final Collector Rule (MANDATORY):** Your plan MUST end with a final "Collector" task using `perform_synthesis` that synthesizes ALL prior task outputs into concise, structured notes for the user or for downstream steps.
            5.  **High-Fidelity Context Flag (OPTIONAL):** If a task REQUIRES raw outputs from prior tasks (precise code, diffs, exact text), include `requires_high_fidelity_context: true` for that task.
            6.  **File System Task Rule:** Tools like `list_directory`, `read_text_file`, and `write_file` can ONLY be used for their specific file system purpose. They CANNOT be used to analyze or summarize content.
    
            --- ❌ EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT ASSIGNMENTS (DO NOT DO THIS) ---
            - {{'description': 'Summarize the findings', 'tool_name': 'list_directory'}}  <-- WRONG! list_directory cannot summarize.
            - {{'description': 'Analyze the code for bugs', 'tool_name': 'read_text_file'}} <-- WRONG! read_text_file cannot analyze.
    
            --- ✅ EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ASSIGNMENTS ---
            - {{'description': 'List the files in the root directory', 'tool_name': 'list_directory'}}
            - {{'description': 'Read the content of the README.md file', 'tool_name': 'read_text_file'}}
            - {{'description': 'Collector: Review the search results and create a summary report', 'tool_name': 'perform_synthesis'}}
    
            ✅ REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ARRAY):
            [{{"description": "Specific description of what this tool will accomplish", "tool_name": "exact_tool_name_from_available_list", "requires_high_fidelity_context": boolean_optional}}]
    
            📋 NEW RULE: THE "COLLECTOR" PATTERN (MANDATORY)
            If a future task requires the combined output of several previous tasks (e.g., writing a final report, summarizing multiple sources), you MUST insert a dedicated "Collector" task right before it.
            - The Collector task MUST use the `perform_synthesis` tool.
            - The Collector task's description MUST contain the word "Collector" and clearly state its job: to gather and synthesize the results from the previous steps with the desired output format.
            - The consuming task MUST depend only on the Collector's output, not on multiple raw outputs directly.

                    You are a TOOL EXECUTION validator. Your ONLY job is to determine if the specific tool executed successfully and produced the output it was supposed to produce for its immediate task.

                    ✅ REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (EXACT JSON OBJECT):

                    }}

                    --- SIMPLIFIED DECISION RULES ---
                    1.  **ONLY Check: Did the tool execute successfully?** Look at the `TOOL RESULT` and `RESULT ANALYSIS`. Did the tool run without errors and produce relevant output for the specific `TASK GOAL`?
                    2.  **IGNORE the bigger picture.** Do NOT consider if the output fits the overall user goal, style preferences, or workflow completeness. That's not your job.
                    3.  **LIBERAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:** If the tool ran and produced ANY reasonable output related to the task (even if minimal), mark it as successful.
                    4.  **ONLY FAIL if:** The tool errored out, returned nothing, or the output is completely unrelated to the immediate task.

                    --- CONTEXT IS FOR REFERENCE ONLY ---
                    The `OVERALL USER GOAL` and `ORIGINAL PLAN` are provided for context only. Do NOT use them to judge success.
                    Your job is NOT to validate the entire workflow - just this one tool execution.

                    --- EXAMPLES OF CORRECT VALIDATION ---
                    ✅ Task: "List files in directory" → Tool returned file list → SUCCESS (even if list is empty)
                    ✅ Task: "Read file content" → Tool returned file content → SUCCESS (even if content is simple)
                    ✅ Task: "Write report to file" → Tool wrote file successfully → SUCCESS (don't judge report quality)
                    ❌ Task: "Search for data" → Tool returned error or crash → FAILURE
                    ❌ Task: "Create summary" → Tool returned completely unrelated content → FAILURE

                    --- CRITICAL RULE ---
                    DO NOT FAIL a tool execution just because you think the output should be "better" or "more complete".
                    If the tool did what it was asked to do without errors, mark it as successful.

        3. TASK_DECOMPOSITION: Break the task into smaller sub-tasks for better handling
        
        --- STRATEGY DEFINITIONS & CAPABILITIES ---
             
        Choose one recovery strategy:
    
         1. `PARAMETER_REPAIR`
            - Fix simple errors in the current tool's parameters.
            - Use when mistakes can be corrected with available information (typos, wrong formats, missing required fields).
            - Do not use if another tool (e.g., `list_directory`) is needed to find missing details.
    
         2. `ALTERNATIVE_TOOL`
            - Switch to a different tool when the current one is unsuitable.
            - Use when the task requires capabilities the chosen tool lacks.
            - Do not use if the tool is correct but its parameters are wrong.
    
    
         3. `TASK_DECOMPOSITION`
            - Break recovery into multiple steps when a single fix isn't enough.
            - Use when you need to gather information (e.g., find a file or search syntax) before retrying.
            - Always choose this for multi-step recovery processes.



        🎯 DECISION FACTORS:
        - CRITICAL RULE: Do NOT repeat a strategy that has already failed. Analyze the history above and choose a different strategy.
        - Error Type: What kind of error occurred (ToolExecutionError, GoalValidationFailure, etc.)
        - Fail Count: How many times the task has failed
        - Task Complexity: Whether the task is simple or complex
        - Available Tools: What other tools could accomplish the same goal
        - Completed Context: What has already been accomplished successfully
        - Failure Patterns: What mistakes have been made recently
        - Validator Feedback: If available, what the goal validator suggested
        - NEVER repeat the same failed strategy

        📊 CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
        - HIGH: Strong evidence supports this strategy (e.g., clear pattern of parameter errors)
        - MEDIUM: Some evidence supports this strategy but alternatives are possible
        - LOW: Uncertain which strategy is best, requires experimentation

        🎯 STRATEGY SELECTION GUIDELINES:
        1. PARAMETER_REPAIR: When the tool is correct but parameters are wrong, especially for file paths, queries, etc.
        2. ALTERNATIVE_TOOL: When the current tool is fundamentally unsuitable or keeps failing despite parameter repair
        3. TASK_DECOMPOSITION: When the task is inherently complex or has failed multiple times (>1) with different approaches

        📋 ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
        - Original Goal: The overarching objective the user wants to achieve
        - Task Description: What this specific task is trying to accomplish
        - Tool Schema: The exact parameters this tool accepts and requires
        - Error Details: What went wrong in previous attempts
        - Recent Context: What has already been accomplished in previous tasks
        - Failure Patterns: What mistakes have been made recently that should be avoided
