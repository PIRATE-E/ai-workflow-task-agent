## ?? Real-World Advanced Workflow Demonstration

### Example: "Research dark web and create analysis file" (Previously Failed)

**BEFORE Enhancement:**
```
? LLM Planning: All 80 tools (overwhelming)
? Generated Tasks:
   - conduct_dark_web_research (HALLUCINATED TOOL)
   - analyze_and_synthesize_report (HALLUCINATED TOOL)
   - write_analysis_to_file (HALLUCINATED TOOL)
? Result: Complete workflow failure
```

**AFTER Enhancement:**
```
? STEP 1 - Tool Pre-filtering:
   Input: "research dark web and create analysis file"
   Recommended: ["GoogleSearch", "sequentialthinking", "write_file"]

? STEP 2 - Enhanced Planning:
   Task 1: GoogleSearch - "search for dark web research information"
   Task 2: sequentialthinking - "analyze search results and create insights"  
   Task 3: write_file - "create analysis.txt with findings"

? STEP 3 - Intelligent Execution:
   - Task 1: Direct execution (simple)
   - Task 2: SPAWNING (complex analysis):
     * SubTask 2.1: Process search results
     * SubTask 2.2: Extract key insights
     * SubTask 2.3: Structure analysis
   - Task 3: Direct execution (simple)

? Result: Complete success with actual dark_web_analysis.txt created
```

    """Convert hierarchical tasks including spawned sub-tasks to agent execution format"""
    agent_exe_array = []
    
    for task in tasks:
        # Handle both parent tasks and spawned sub-tasks
        if task.status in ['pending', 'in_progress']:
            agent_task = {
                "tool_name": task.tool_name,
                "reasoning": f"Hierarchical task {task.task_id}: {task.description}",
                "parameters": task.execution_context.parameters if task.execution_context else {},
                "is_spawned_subtask": isinstance(task.task_id, float),
                "parent_task_id": int(task.task_id) if isinstance(task.task_id, float) else None
            }
            agent_exe_array.append(agent_task)
